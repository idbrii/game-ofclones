Unity's [FAQ](http://unity3d.com/unity/faq) outlines the restrictions on using
the code and assets.

> **Can we use the code/art/assets in Unity Technologies' example projects?**

> Yes, all assets in our tutorial and example projects may be used in both
> commercial and non-commercial use in Unity-based projects. The assets
> themselves may not be resold, however. Note that these assets are widely
> known in the games industry, so if you do use them in your titles it may be
> obvious that you re-used Unity assets.
