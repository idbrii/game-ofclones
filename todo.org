TODO

* Create a base Mob class that is used by all moving objects.
** Abstract from PlayerControl.
** Abstract from Enemy.
** Contains information about desired motion, jump state, and collision.
* Create a PlayerSpoke class that follows the motion of the PlayerControl script.
** Has reference to PlayerControl so it can copy its movements.

* Start spawning PlayerSpokes
** First pass: spawn them instead of enemies.
   If they contact they player or each other, they die (excluding the player).
** Second pass: kill the player on contact.
   Needs to respawn player on death (does this already?)
 
* Create buttons that activate spawner to create a clone.
